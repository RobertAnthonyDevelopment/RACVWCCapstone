            <h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have worn many hats, but most of all, I have enjoyed my time as a lead Training Manager for a team of four co-workers that served more than 200 people employed in a variety of positions. I immensely enjoyed scheduling their tests, reviewing their records, and giving them the tools to take charge of their careers and help them develop professionally and personally.</p>
            <p>I further challenged myself by becoming the program manager for an introductory life-saving skills course. Additionally, I used my abilities to evaluate and train instructors to be more efficient facilitators. The moments that stood out the most in my career were abundant. However, a few overshadow the rest. The first was when I helped facilitate diversity training for more than 100 members of my organization to help ensure a safe work environment for members of all backgrounds. The second was when I served as a facilitator for a resiliency workshop that focused on employee mental health and ensuring they had the tools to cope with the struggles of everyday life.</p>
